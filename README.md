# eTag: Class-Incremental Learning via Hierarchical Embedding Distillation and Task-Oriented

## Introduction

The key training and evaluation codes for the AAAI-2024 paper "eTag: Class-Incremental Learning via Hierarchical Embedding Distillation and Task-Oriented Generation" exist.

## Requirement

- python = 3.8.5
- torch = 1.7.1
- torchvision = 0.8.2

## How to run

Please confirm the dataset is well downloaded or softly linked in the file "./dataset" at first.

You can test our method by executing the script we provide, or by running the following command in the path "./scripts"

```sh
# on cifar with 5 tasks
bash -i run.sh cifar 0 5
# on cifar with 10 tasks
bash -i run.sh cifar 0 10
# on cifar with 25 tasks
bash -i run.sh cifar 0 25
```

```sh
# on imagenet_sub with 5 tasks
bash -i run.sh imagenet 0 5
# on imagenet_sub with 10 tasks
bash -i run.sh imagenet 0 10
# on imagenet_sub with 25 tasks
bash -i run.sh imagenet 0 25
```

### arguments

- `-data`: The name of the data you want to test, you can choose from one of them {`cifar100`, `imagenet_sub`} currently.
- `-log_dir`: Where the models, logs, and events are saved.
- `-num_task`: Number of tasks after initializing the first task.
- `-nb_cl_fg`: Number of classes in the first task.

For more tunable arguments, please look at the `opts_eTag.py` file.
